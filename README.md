# Network-TrafficAnomaly-Detection-Using-ML
Project analyzes real network traffic to classify benign and malicious activity using ML algorithms like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, K-NN, and XGBoost. It aims to optimize accuracy while reducing false positives/negatives, enhancing network security through robust traffic pattern detection.
